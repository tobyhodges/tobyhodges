I'm a bioinformatician turned community coordinator, 
who enjoys teaching computational research skills and
creating high-quality lesson material.
I help members of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) community create new lessons,
using design approaches based on the current runderstanding of how people learn.
Check out @carpentries-incubator to see some of the lessons we're building together.

If you're interested in creating a lesson yourself,
or you'd like to contribute to or review a lesson already under development,
I'd love to chat.
