I'm a bioinformatician turned community coordinator, 
who enjoys teaching computational research skills and
creating high-quality lesson material.

Currently collaborating with other members of The Carpentries community on 
[a curriculum for Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/)

If you're interested in creating a lesson yourself,
or you'd like to contribute to or review a lesson already under development,
I'd love to chat.
